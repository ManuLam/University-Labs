// Lab-3c
//Write a Java program that uses a while-loop to check how many times an integer num1 can be divided by 2 before the number 
//becomes less than 2. The program should then print to the screen the number of times num1 can be successively divided by 2.
//Set num1 to the default 40 when evaluating.

public class While {
public static void main(String[]args) {
    
    int num1=40;
    int f=1;
    
    while(num1>2) {
        num1=num1/2;
        f++;
        }
    System.out.println(f);
