// Lab161-2f
// Write a Java program that prints out the fee to use a golf course depending on whether the user is a member or not. 
// If the user is a member the fee is 5 and if not the fee is 20. 
// You must use the ternary operator. 
// A variable of type char called member should have the value 'Y' or 'N' which decides if the user is a member or not.
// An integer called fee holds the the fee given from the ternary operator. Evaluate with member = 'N'.

public static void main(String[]args) {
    int fee = 0;
    char member='y';
   
    fee = ('y'==member) ? 20:5;
    System.out.print("The fee is: "+fee);
