// Lab-3f
// Write a Java program that uses a do-while loop to determine if a positive integer number (called num) is a prime number.
// A number is prime if it is divisible only by 1 and itself. For example, 13 is prime but 12 is not (divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12).

public class DoWhile {
public static void main(String[]args) {
    int num=12;
    int num1=1;
    final int number=num;
    int f=0;
    
    do {
        if(number%num1==0) {
            f++; }
            num1++;
    }
    while(num>num1);
    
    if(f==1)
    System.out.println(num+" is a prime number");
    else {System.out.println(num+" is NOT a prime number");
        }
