// Lab161-1d
// Write a Java program that:
// Declares an integer, called num1, and sets its value to be 5.
// Declares a double, called num2, and sets its value to be 2.3.
// Declares a character variable, called letter, and sets its value to be 's'.
// Prints each initialised variable on a new line. 
// You must not use print statements to print out the 5, 2.3 or s, but use them to print out the variables using their names.
