### 🎯 Assignment Three - A Multithreaded Multicast Chat Client (Multicast Chat Application)
Implement a simple chat client which transmits user text messages entered at the keyboard to a multicast address and also can simultaneously receive messages sent from other clients on other machines sent to the same multicast address.

### 🎯 Assignment Five - RealTime Train Schedule Display (XML Data To HTML display)
The following REST API URL returns an XML document containing realtime information about Train Times from Enfield Station with a 90min look ahead period.

http://api.irishrail.ie/realtime/realtime.asmx/getStationDataByCodeXML_WithNumMins?StationCode=ENFLD&NumMins=90&format=xml

Write a program that can fetch this realtime xml feed for your chosen stop, parses it and displays the train times in a more readable tabular form (in a HTML page perhaps) with Expected Arrival Time, Origin, Destination, Expected Departure Time, Arrival Time at Destination.
